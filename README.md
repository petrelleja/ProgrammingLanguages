# ProgrammingLanguages



# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project included code for a grocery store to analyze, and print reports of records of produce purchased in a given day. There is a user interface coded in C++, prompting the user to enter a number 1 through 4 printing different reports or exiting to program. C++ communicates and passes information to Python in order to analyze the data and return data back to C++ or print reports.

# What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well in having the two different languages, C++ and Python, communicate. I was able to call the correct functions from C++ to communicate with Python and to pass data to Python from C++. I was also able to create dictionaries with Python code and access/update them when adding a new element or adding to an existing elements value.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could have been better with its input validation. For option 2 in the code, the user must enter a produce item with a capital letter and an 's' at the end where applicable in order to be able to search through Python's dictionary. If the user enters a word in all lowercase, then my code will say that the word is not in the list. Making this change would make my code accept more types of user input and have better input validation.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it most challenging to decide what would be completed in Python and what would be completed in C++. At first, I thought that C++ would be responsible for reading the file's contents and then passing each line of code to Python from that read. This caused my code to have multiple calls to Python and never fill a list since Python kept declaring an empty list at the beginning of its code. I resolved this by having Python read the file instead. Another issue I faced was with Syntax for the two different languages. To resolve this issue, I would refer back to https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp and https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp for the syntax requirements of each language. These websites are tools that I will be adding to my support network.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
My work with the programming languages C++ and Python can be transferred to other projects that I work on in the future. Knowing each individual language's syntax will be important for coding in that language. I will also be able to use what I learned about C++ passing variables to Python and apply that to other projects. Another thing I will be able to use is the ability to create and analyze lists within Python. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this code maintainable by breaking the code up into different and multiple functions. I made the code readable by including appropriate indentations, in line comments, and extra lines to break up relevant code. I made my code adaptable by keeping main extremely short and having most of the logic completed in functions.
